 * Experience in working with version control systems (git) and software configuration tools (CMake).

### Numerical and Statistical Methods

 * Developing and Applying spectral methods to perform NWP parameter transforms.
 * Monte Carlo radiative transfer (developing new methods to model the transmission of radiation through media with various optical properties).
 * Bayesian inference and machine learning (e.g., Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, k-nearest neighbours, artificial neural nets). 

### Teamwork and Line Management

 * Line manager of a team of software engineers, delivering next generation data assimilation capability.
 * Spinning up new starters in the field of data assimilation and scientific software engineering.
 * Supporting the work and personal development of PhD students in the Cardiff star formation group.

### Teaching and Training
